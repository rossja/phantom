// Teaches the main agent (Opus 4.6) to write its own learnings into a single
// canonical file at phantom-config/memory/agent-notes.md via the Write or
// Edit tool. Research across three VMs (108 lifetime sessions, 117 applied
// evolution deltas) showed the agent memory audit log has two rows lifetime,
// both user-authored, zero agent-originated writes. The path was empirically
// empty. This block lights it up.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow: one canonical file, append-only, short dated
// entries, no reorganization. Multiple files and free-form memory targets are
// out of scope for Phase 0 and can land in a later project with its own
// design. The block is intentionally small (target under 400 tokens) so it
// does not bloat the system prompt on every query.
